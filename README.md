# SmartChrono-BC
School graduation subject - Creation of a SmartChrono for [Burniaux Consulting](https://www.burniaux.com/).

Hello there! :wave:<br>
Welcome to my graduation project.<br>
This is a mobile project, a smart stopwatch that allows you to save time data to a management application, such as [odoo](https://www.odoo.com) in this case.<br>

## Features
- Stopwatch start/stop functionality: User can start and stop the stopwatch manually to measure the time spent on a particular task.
- Task association: The user can associate each start/stop time of the stopwatch to a particular task related to a project.
- Data logging: The measured time data for each task is saved on the user's phone and can be sent to a server for later use.
- Generation of timesheets: Recorded data can be used to automatically generate timesheets.
- Time analysis: Recorded data can be analyzed to measure time spent on particular tasks and specific projects.
- Automatic invoicing: The recorded data can be used to automatically generate invoices for the hours worked.

This app is for anyone who wants to track and account for time spent on specific projects, like lawyers who get paid by the hour and IT people.

## On going
### Proof of concept
The design is done entirely with basic JavaScript. The goal is to be able to present a model that works in a web browser and to easily make changes to it.
### Migration to REACT-Native.
Once the design and functionalities have been approved, a code migration is planned to switch entirely to REACT-Native in order to create cross-platform code between Android and iOS.
### Compiling to :iphone:
Last step, compilation from REACT-Native to Android and iOS and publication.
